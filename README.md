## ℹ️ Project
SimpleChatJS is a web chat made using Javascript and Firebase. Its operation is based on sending messages to the database and whenever a message is added, its content is downloaded and displayed to all users (including the one who sent the message). First, to save resources, whenever a new user enters the chat, the conversation history is cleared to save resources. But in the next versions I will add information control with Node.js, to separate the client from the server
